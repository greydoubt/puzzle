# puzzle

sort of inspired by this: https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2024/08/determing-which-math-problems-are-hard.html

Functions: Resonance Cascade (0) composed over gamma function (or call it Riemannian Gradient) 

Layer Zero: Some Seed Sigma σ : 
Sigma resonance 
Basic atomic element

Layer One:
single σ for Field Resonance λ.Γ(σ)
lambda Gamma(seed σ for some local tree λ.τ)

Each τ becomes a larger tree using this functional model 

The Greek Constructions of trisecting an angle, duplicating the cube, and squaring the circle. The problem is that the statement:

In 400BC the Greeks posed the question: Prove or Disprove that one can trisect an angle with a ruler and compass

is false on many level:

a) Nobody thought of prove or disprove back in 400BC (and that date is to precise). 

b) Why would a compass, which helps you find where North is, help you with this problem?

(ADDED LATER: Some of the comments indicate that people do not know that point b is a joke. Perhaps not a good joke, but a joke.)
